This repository contains Emozionalmente: the most extensive speech emotional corpus in Italian at the moment of writing. The dataset consists of 6902 labeled samples acted out by 431 amateur actors while verbalizing 18 different sentences expressing the Big Six emotions (anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise) plus neutrality. Labels represent the emotional communicative intention of the actors (i.e., the seven emotional states). 
Recordings were generally obtained with non-professional equipment. They are .wav files, mono-channel, and have a sample size of 16 bits and a sample rate of 16000 Hz. Each audio recording lasts 3.81 seconds (SD = 0.99 seconds). 
We validated the emotional content of the clips by asking 829 humans (5 evaluations per audio) to guess the emotion contained in each recording. Humans obtained a general accuracy of 66% (comparable with previous literature in the field).

Beyond the audio data, in the repo, you can find three .csv files describing the demographics of the actors and the evaluators and the emotions they expressed and recognized for each of the audios. 

Soon we will publish a paper with more information about the dataset, including data acquisition methodology, participant demographics, and data validation. Please cite "Emozionalmente: a crowd-sourced Italian speech emotional corpus" by Fabio Catania if you use this dataset.
